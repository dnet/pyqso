It provides a simple graphical interface through which users can manage information about the contacts/QSOs they make with other operators on the air. All information is stored in a light-weight SQL database. Other key features include:\r\n\r\n* Customisable interface (e.g. only show callsign and frequency information).\r\n* Import and export logs in ADIF format.\r\n* Perform callsign lookups and auto-fill data fields using the qrz.com database.\r\n* Sort the logs by individual fields.\r\n* Print a hard-copy of logs, or print to PDF.\r\n* Connect to Telnet-based DX clusters.\r\n* Progress tracker for the DXCC award.\r\n* Grey line plotter.\r\n* Filter out QSOs based on the callsign field (e.g. only display contacts with callsigns beginning with \"M6\").\r\n* Remove duplicate QSOs.\r\n* Basic support for the Hamlib library.\r\n\r\nThe source code for PyQSO is available for download at: https://github.com/ctjacobs/pyqso\r\n\r\n![The PyQSO main window.](https://raw.github.com/ctjacobs/pyqso/master/doc/images/log_with_awards.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
